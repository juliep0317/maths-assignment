    <h1>Maths Assignment</h1>
    <p> For my maths assignment project, I was tasked to create a calculation using Javascript that calculated the mean of 5 decimal numbers. <br />
    </p>
    <p> I started by creating a array for the provided decimals numbers, then I created a function for the sum values.</p>
    <p> After the array and function was created, I created a for loop and used a Math object to finally calculate the mean.</p>
    <p> In order to calculate the mean, all the numbers need to be added together and then divided by the amount of number.</p>
    <p> The decimals numbers used in this assignment were 4.2, 5.1, 3.8, 4.7, 5.3.</p>
